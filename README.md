This repository will contain code corresponding to analysis reported in [Portraits of genetic intra-tumour heterogeneity and subclonal selection across cancer types](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/07/312041)

The submodules in this repository will link to the version of the code that was used to produce the results and are provided as a permanent archive. Some of the methods may see further development, therefore, if you're interested in applying a method it is encouraged to go to the linked repositories and check out the latest version there.
